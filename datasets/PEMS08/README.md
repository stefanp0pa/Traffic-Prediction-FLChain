We have found an interesting traffic dataset PEMS-08 Dataset, which contains the traffic data in San Bernardino from July to August in 2016. There are 170 locations with detectors recording every 5 minute intervals of traffic information. The dataset includes 3 features: flow, occupy, speed. The details of the features are as the following:

The flow variable in the PEMS08 dataset represents the number of vehicles that pass through the loop detector per time interval (5 minutes in this case). It is measured in vehicles per 5-minute interval.

The occupancy variable represents the proportion of time during the time interval (5 minutes) that the detector was occupied by a vehicle. It is measured as a percentage.

The speed variable represents the average speed of the vehicles passing through the loop detector during the time interval (5 minutes). It is measured in miles per hour (mph).
